# What's up, I'm Noah

I'm currently on a gap year as a high school grad. During this time, I founded my first startup, antifragility.io, scaled it to six-figure ARR, and got acquired.

Post-acquisition, I'm a PM @ Clover Labs and interning @ Wealthsimple working in product for margins trading.

Prior to this I did some other internships and consulting for startups backed by Y-Combinator, Accel, etc.
